I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and [EHESS](https://www.ehess.fr/fr){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research is supervised by [Suanna Oh](https://www.suannaoh.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Thierry Verdier](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/verdier-thierry/){:target="_blank"}, with [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/){:target="_blank"} serving on my thesis committee.

I previously completed my BA and MSc at [CIDE](https://www.cide.edu/division_de/){:target="_blank"} in Mexico.

My primary field is the political economy of development. My doctoral research investigates how historical legacies, institutional arrangements, and cultural identities shape persistent inequalities across space and social groups. 
<!--- Drawing on insights from historical and cultural economics and employing spatial methods, I aim to identify the structural forces underlying these disparities and contribute to strategies that promote inclusive development. --->

My current projects explore:
  1.	How colonial-era segregation shapes modern urban inequality, combining evidence on land prices and educational outcomes with a focus on neighborhood identity as a persistent cultural mechanism.
  2.	How skin tone shapes economic inequality, drawing on cross-country evidence on income and educational mobility, novel machine-assessed skin tone measures, and causal estimates of discrimination.
<!--- 3. The role of worker-owned and socially embedded firms in fostering local economic development, especially in underserved communities. --->

In addition, I pursue a separate line of research on the political economy of populism, showing how populist uncertainty depresses economic activity and how leaders’ cues—rather than partisanship preferences—undermine public health behavior.
